# Accident Severity Prediction 🚗💥

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the **severity of road accidents** based on various factors such as driver details, vehicle attributes, and environmental conditions. 
The goal is to assist authorities in **risk assessment, prevention strategies, and emergency response planning**.

The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled using **Python** and **Machine Learning techniques**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** *(Add dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle link or government data)*
- **Format:** CSV
- **Target Variable:** `Accident_Severity` (categorical)
- **Size:** *(Add rows × columns count here)*

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Import & Exploration**
   - Load dataset and inspect structure.
   - Identify missing and inconsistent values.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Drop columns with >80% missing values.
   - Impute missing categorical values with `"Unknown"`.
   - Fill missing ages with median.
   - Remove unrealistic age values.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Convert time to categorical bins (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
   - Create age categories.
   - Encode categorical variables.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots for numerical features.
   - Correlation heatmaps.
   - Accident severity patterns by time, age, and other features.

5. **Modeling**
   - Train-Test split.
   - Train models such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, or **Logistic Regression**.
   - Hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

6. **Results**
   - Achieved **99.73% Accuracy** on the test set.
   - Key factors influencing accident severity include: *(List top features here)*
